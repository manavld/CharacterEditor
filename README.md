# CharacterEditor
 This software allows you to customize a provided base mesh to export a desired low poly character with all textures included for game development.
 This is a completely free software created for my bachelor's thesis in the Videogame Development and Design degree taken in Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. The objective of this project is to help students and videogame companies, who do not have the time, knowledge or money, to create characters for their games without having to follow the complete 3D modelling pipeline.
